# AGENTS

This repository uses a small set of autonomous agents to help with tasks such as research, code exploration, and testing. The following table lists the available agents, their purpose, and how they can be invoked.

| Agent | Purpose | Typical Use Cases |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **general** | General‑purpose agent for researching complex questions and executing multi‑step tasks. | Fetching documentation, searching codebases, running external tools, building projects, writing tests.
| **explore** | Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. | Find files by pattern, search for symbols or keywords, answer “how does X work?” queries.

## Invoking an Agent
Agents are launched via the `task` tool:
```bash
# Example: run a quick exploration of all C‑Next source files
assistant: task(
  description="Search for .cnx files",
  prompt="glob pattern='**/*.cnx'",
  subagent_type="explore"
)
```
The agent will return the results directly in its final message.

## Important Guidelines
- **Never file issues without user approval.** If an issue is discovered, first create a minimal reproducer and verify it before filing.
- **No workarounds.** Do not patch or hide bugs; document them and wait for a proper fix.
- **Use C‑Next syntax helper skill when unsure about language constructs.**

## Useful Skills
| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `cnext-syntax-helper` | Explains C‑Next syntax, features, and design decisions. Use it for any questions about C‑Next usage.

## Additional Context for Agents

The following sections summarize key information from the project that may aid agents when they interact with the codebase:

- **Project Overview** – OSSM is an embedded firmware for Teensy 4.x that reads automotive sensors and sends J1939‑compliant CAN messages. It emulates a secondary PCM/ECM.
- **J1939 Compliance** – All byte order, scaling, offsets, and PGN formats must follow SAE J1939 exactly.
- **Build Commands** – Use `pio run`, `pio run --target upload`, `pio run --target clean`, and `pio device monitor`.
- **Architecture** – Source lives in `src/Domain`, `src/Display`, `src/Data`. Three layer cake, Domain is the business logic.
- **C‑Next Transpiler Workflow** – Includes use of angle brackets for includes, relative path resolution from `src/`, and the rule to create bug reproducers under `~/code/c-next2/bugs/issue‑<name>/`.
- **C-Next is transpiled** - On every build c-next transpiles .cnx files to .h and .cpp, so editing .h and .cpp will be overridden on the next build. You must edit the .cnx files. Analogy: .cnx is to .h and .cpp and .ts is to .js
- **Include order matters** - Always import system libaries before .cnx files, aka, <Arduino.h> before "myFile.cnx"
- **C-Next is Alpha** - C-Next is in alpha, it has many bugs. Our goal with OSSM to find those bugs and report them to jlaustill/c-next
